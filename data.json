For instance, I think users should only be able to pan over the Y access for this particular visualization. I think the viewport should be isometric, not orthographic. I wanted the option to add GLSL shaders and filters. I honestly don't think it is particularily useful to let users drag nodes around a 3d visualization, especially with 2d screens. With VR/AR things might change, but I'm going to delay adding that functionality to this boiler plate for now. Instead, the nodes shold be filterable and sortable in a reasonable way.\n\nThe basics of the visualization portion of this project is a flat plane with the particular map (this may later be an extruded mesh surface), with location nodes links to particular portions of that map, and the other nodes connected to that location node in semi random order floating above / in front of that node.\n\n#### Neo4j notes\n\nI am trying to decide if I want to use the more standard D3 structure for nodes / edges or just use the standard NEO export.",

He said: \"that is really interesting of you to say, Lindsey, because everything that you do is just so fucking ugly.\"\n\nI must concede the point. I do not feel that my job of a designer is really done until something is so ugly it only functions. A good way to judge this is to make something uglier than it needs to be. If it is actively difficult to look at you are only left with how it moves and interacts with the user. I know the business guys only care about if their brand colors pop (because they suffer from aphantasia), but I'm looking for something else when I plan something.\n\nI shun prettiness, skeumorphism in my design. I try to understand the inner logic of what I'm trying to build, and let that dictate the function. This means I rarely look for the golden section.\n\nBut that is the core of the designer (as opposed to the decorator or illustrator or engineer mindset). A good design doesn't look like anything except itself. It is a an overview of a system, an interface.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't get hired as a designer, and every time I've tried to engage in that world it is disastrous.",

Remember that awful Matt Damon movie where he's on Mars, and then survives and at the end gives that trite little speech about solving one problem after another? The whole movie follows that conceit, that engineering way of mind, and people like it because it's clever. But it's still bullshit. In the chaos of the universe Matt Damon would be dead on Mars, because fuck ups in that situation at those stakes are always deadly.\n\nAnd a lot of that particular frame of mind-- I have a large problem, I break it down into small problems and solve them-- produces massive problems itself. \"Second Order Effects\", \"Cobra Problems\". People have all sorts of interesting phrases to describe them. We are facing the big bad motherfucker of second order effects, the so-called anthropocene. We had a problem: we wanted stuff. So we solved all the little problems that had to do with making stuff. And we solved all of those little problems-- how to you make a cell phone? how do you move that cell phone from Senschen to Los Anglees to Demoines, Iowa? Meat tastes amazing, and so we solved the smaller problem of how to raise an industrial amount of cattle and put them through a system that spits it out at the grocery store so you never have to think about how to raise, feed, slaughter, divy up and package a cow yourself -- and then we forgot about how we were going to actually power the contraption. We missed the big problem-- that the world is mutable, and climate and resources are not static -- when we solved all the little ones. If you engineer on a team you see these sorts of problems cropping up all the time-- an engineer solves a problem, and hands it off to another engineer who solves another problem all down the line until the user does something you didn't think about and suddenly the server is crashing and your manager is calling you and you have no idea how you ended up in that situation.\n\nWilliam Gibson calls the coming thicket of calamity barreling down on us all \"the jackpot\". I like that term-- it describes how sudden and unbelievable that moment is.\n\nBut does that mean that frame of mind, that pose, is particularily bad? No. It's useful. How I'm writing this is an engineering perspective-- I can't help it, I spend a lot of my life breaking down big problems and solving the little ones bit by bit. I thought: I have this problem, this massive, confusing problem I'm trying to figure out, and I can only solve it by striking a pose. So I started writing this-- using graphs and machine learning and writing little snippets (even smaller attempts than Montaigne) -- by solving the small problems one by one.\n\nI'm not saying I'm not wrong, but I like to think I am wrong for the right reason",

One only need to walk down the street to see how ridiculous this particular insanity of human proportion is. Human beings are creatures of spectacular variation, and every guideline and tick leads us not toward truth but toward a cultural null point, a negation of what is real. When you draw like this the Kardashians win.\n\nI spent a lot of years drawing people on the bus, and I have had several conversations with peoples whose second cousin Tony or whatever could draw Wolverine just like the comic books, and he's a good artist-- my stuff is terrible.\n\nThese \"artists\", who are wrong, develop a series of processese and ticks to generate images-- they cross hatch a certain way, they use a thicker marker on the edges, they have a series of tactics but no real process. Their images all look the same, they conform to an approved standard of what is good. They can process images, and give you a representation, but they can tell you nothing about how they actually see an image. They lie, but innefectively.\n\nIt's not just drawing. Art schools, with their dedication to justifying themselves in late capitalism, have become focus groups to generate an artist's brand. An expensive branding operation, though I've seen more expensive and futile. When an official artist leaves art school they have their thing: they put tape on plexiglass just so, the writhe on the discarded food of the gallery floor a specific way that has the official sanction of being art school and gallerist approved.\n\nMe and Goya are in agreement: this is all bullshit. Art is not a series of ticks and tactics, but a method of seeing. I fully concede my drawings are rarely beautiful. But I'm not trying to draw beautifully-- that is a distraction, the mistake everyone else is making. I'm trying to generate an expression of my process of seeing. I am trying to express the sensory experience of what I am drawing, Even if it comes from within my mind, the image does not exist yet when I am generating it.

I bought this watch on the first anniversary of me quitting drinking. I had been thinking about this watch for years after meeting the watch maker at some fashion event in 2013. I have the green band and the white face.\n\nIt's a winder, and every morning I crank it 36 rotations and none further. To me it serves as a kind of bellwether: if I notice my watch has stopped it means I am losing my balance-- that other habits might be slipping, I might be missing something important, I might be a little overheated and need to slow down. It's better than any fitbit-- I actually pay attention to it. As a luxury it works as a totem of my success and balance I've worked hard to achieve in life.",
